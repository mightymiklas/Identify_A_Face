# Identify A Face With DLib's Facial Landscape Recongition. 

This is a simple tool to identify a face based upon Davis E. King's machine learning toolkit in C++. I chose this library because it seems to have the most straightforward approach to facial recongition using maching learning among all the Python ML libraries that are out there. This application is inspired by this [project](https://evamo0508.github.io/files/2019Spring-introduction_to_computer_network-FaceDanceMachine.pdf) and this [repository](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition). I plan to add upon this repository further and play around more with what can be done.
